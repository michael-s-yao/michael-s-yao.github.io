Currently: Medical student

I am an MD-PhD candidate at the University of Pennsylvania. My research focuses on **trustworthy machine learning** and how we can reliably use ML systems under distribution shift. I am interested in intelligently leveraging prior knowledge and data to help algorithms better generalize to new distributions. I explore these problems in the setting of healthcare and AI4Science. I am grateful to be have been advised by [Osbert Bastani](https://trustml.github.io) and [James Gee](https://picsl.upenn.edu) during my PhD.

I am grateful to be supported by an [NIH F30 NRSA Fellowship](https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/11194234) from the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD).

## Outreach

I designed and run a short course on the [fundamentals of ML for medical students](https://eamc-penn.github.io). I have previously served as Vice Chair of the Technology Committee for the [American Physician Scientists Association (APSA)](https://www.physicianscientists.org) and as Director of Data Science and AI for [MDplus](http://ai.mdplus.community). At Penn, I am involved in a number of mentorship and outreach initiatives and have served on both the Admissions Committee and AI Curriculum Steering Committee for the School of Medicine.

I am actively involved in Penn's interview and recruitment process for medical school admissions. I set aside half an hour a week to meet with current students for pro bono feedback on applications and general college advice, especially for underrepresented students from minority backgrounds. If you're interested in connecting, feel free to reach out to me via email or Twitter.
